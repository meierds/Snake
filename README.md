# Snake
Classic snake game, written in Javascript with animations on the HTML5 canvas.

This was mostly created as an exercise in slightly more advanced JS techniques and was intentionally written without the use of
extensive libraries, such as JQuery.

A working version (without the food animations) can be found at the following link:

The game is NOT browser optimized, and is intended to run in chrome. Has not been tested in any others. 
To use the game, you will have to fork the repository to your computer and add in the file names and paths in the blank spots provided.
I am currently working on getting a github page for this, but have not had time yet. 

If you would like to make edits, please see the issues page to find out where you can help me improve the game.
